# Asynchronous Android Programming

This is the code repository for [Asynchronous Android Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/asynchronous-android-programming?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785883248), published by [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/). It contains all the required files to run the code.

##What you need for this book

To follow along and experiment with the examples, you will need a development 
computer with a Java 7 (or 8) SE Development Kit and the Android Software 
Development Kit Version 9 or above (you will need at least Version 21 to try all of 
the examples).
You will also need Android Studio IDE. The examples have been developed using 
Google's new Android Studio IDE and use its integrated build system, Gradle.
While you can run the examples using the emulator provided by the Android SDK, it 
is a poor substitute for the real thing. A physical Android device is a much faster and 
more pleasurable way to develop and test Android applications!
Many of the examples will work on a device running any version of Android since 
2.3, GingerBread. Some examples demonstrate newer APIs and as a result, require a 
more recent Android versionâ€”up to Android 5, Lollipop.
